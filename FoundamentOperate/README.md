# Some Foundament Operation of PyTorch

Introduction to PyTorch with these samples:

- Some operate about basic type `Tensors`

    - `introduce.py` : Introduce common torch tensor operation.

    - `pytorch_numpy.py` : Compare tensor operation in `PyTorch` and `Numpy`

    - `pytorch_variable.py` :  How to set variable operation that can auto calculate grade via `backward()`
    
    - `Autograd.py` : Set auto grade with troch via common attr `requires_grad`

- Some regular func introduce

    - `pytorch_activation.py` : Showing different activate func curve
